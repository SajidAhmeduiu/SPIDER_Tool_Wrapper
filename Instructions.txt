1) Install Anaconda from (https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)

2) Activate Anaconda

3) Create a python 2.7 conda environment using the command (conda create --environment_name py2 python=2.7)

4) Activate the environment using the command (conda activate environment_name)

5) Now, navigate to the location where you have stored "pssm_input_SPIDER_output.py" file and "dat" folder containing the trained neural
network parameter files required for predicting structural properties from PSSM files in the python file.

6) Store your PSSM files in a folder in the same location where you have previously stored the python file and the dat folder.

7) Create a folder in the same location as the PSSM folder for storing the output .spd3 files.

8) run the command (python pssm_input_SPIDER_output.py PSSM_Directory SPIDER_output_Directory) where PSSM_Directory is the folder
containing your PSSM files with .pssm extension and SPIDER_output_Directory is the folder containing the corresponding output files with
.spd3 extension.
