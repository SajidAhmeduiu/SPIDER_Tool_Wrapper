# SPIDER_Tool_Wrapper

This is a wrapper for a tool named SPIDER that predicts 1-dimensional structual properties of protein sequences from PSSM profiles. 

The SPIDER tool was developed as part of the paper titled "Improving prediction of secondary structure, local backbone angles, and solvent accessible surface area of proteins by iterative deep learning" authored by Rhys Heffernan, Kuldip Paliwal, James Lyons, Abdollah Dehzangi, Alok Sharma, Jihua Wang, Abdul Sattar, Yuedong Yang and Yaoqi Zhou. [Published in Scientific Reports in 2015].

The tool is written in python 2.7
