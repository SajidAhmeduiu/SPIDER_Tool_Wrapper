# SPIDER_Tool_Wrapper

This is a wrapper for a tool named SPIDER written in python 2.7 that predicts 1-dimensional structual properties of protein sequences from PSSM profiles. 

The SPIDER tool was developed as part of the paper titled "Improving prediction of secondary structure, local backbone angles, and solvent accessible surface area of proteins by iterative deep learning" authored by Rhys Heffernan, Kuldip Paliwal, James Lyons, Abdollah Dehzangi, Alok Sharma, Jihua Wang, Abdul Sattar, Yuedong Yang and Yaoqi Zhou. [Published in Scientific Reports in 2015].

I used this tool while working on a paper titled "idti-esboost: Identification of drug target interaction using evolutionary and structural features with boosting" [Published in Scientific Reports in 2017] with the help of.

I tried to use the tool again recently, but faced some errors. So, I solved those errors and made it a bit easier to use by adding a small functionality so that it can read all PSSM profiles stored in a directory and output corresponding SPIDER files in another directory.
